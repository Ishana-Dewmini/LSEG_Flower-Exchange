This repository contains the source code for a simple trading system. The trading system is designed to handle orders and maintain an order book for buying and selling financial instruments.
Users should save the order list in a CSV file with the header "ClientOrderID,Instrument,Side,Quantity,Price". The columns of an order row should be in this order.
After running the TraderApp.cpp, users should enter the name of the CSV file that contains the order list.
Upon completing the execution process, users can find a CSV file named "execution_reports" which contains the report of the trading process.
